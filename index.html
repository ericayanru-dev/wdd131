            <div class="card1">
                <p>Hi, I’m Eric Ayanru. I’m passionate about technology, programming, and practical problem-solving. 
                    I currently study Python, web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and data concepts while using them to solve real life problem. 
                    I also manage a fish farm, where I apply tech skills to improve operations and efficiency. 
                    I love learning new things, building useful projects, and finding ways to integrate technology into real-life solutions. 
                    My goals include becoming a skilled software developer and using tech to create impact in my community and beyond.
                </p>

                    <p>Delta State, created in 1991, is in southern Nigeria with Asaba as capital and Warri as its main commercial city. 
                        It lies in the Niger Delta region, rich in oil and gas, making it vital to Nigeria’s economy. 
                        Ethnic groups include Urhobo, Itsekiri, Ijaw, Isoko, and Anioma (Igbo). 
                        The state also thrives in agriculture, producing cassava, yams, and palm oil. 
                        Its landscape features mangrove swamps and river networks, though challenged by pollution from oil activities. 
                        Delta has 25 LGAs, a strong cultural heritage, and is nicknamed “The Big Heart” for its economic and strategic importance.
